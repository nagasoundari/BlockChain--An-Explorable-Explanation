Block chain and crypto currencies are the buzz words you hear everyday. Have you ever wondered what is a block chain?

As the name suggests, a blockchain is a chain of blocks that contains information. This technique was originally described by a group of researchers in 1991 and was intended to time stamp digital documents rendering them impossible to backdate them; almost like a notary. However, it went by mostly unused until 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto adapted it to invent the digital cryptocurrency: Bitcoin.

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is completely open to anyone. It is a way of storing data so that cannot be changed anymore. This is called immutability and a very useful feature when dealing with very important data like bank records or transactions.
