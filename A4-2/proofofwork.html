Given the efficiency of the modern technology, one can effectively tamper with a block and re-calculate the hashes of all the other blocks. Thus, hashing is not enough to prevent tampering of a block in the block-chain. To mitigate this is a new concept called “proof-of-work”.

Proof-of-work is a mechanism that slows down the creation of new blocks. In the case of Bitcoins, it takes about 10 minutes to calculate the required proof-of-work and add a new block to the chain. This mechanism makes it very hard to tamper with the block, because if one tampers with a block, proof of work needs to be calculated for all the subsequent blocks.

Click on any block to tamper with it and calculate the required proof-of-work.

Thus the security of a block comes from its creative use of hashing and proof-of-work.
